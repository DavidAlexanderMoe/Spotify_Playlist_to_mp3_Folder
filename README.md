# Download Spotify Playlist to local folder

The idea of this program came from the need to download playlist which were already created directly on spotify (which were large).
Everybody uses some kind of websites or apps to download music or videos from youtube, but my problem was that i did not have any playlists on youtube!
It was really boring and time consuming to recreate my spotify playlists on youtube (i needed to search each single song and add it to the new youtube playlist), so I thought i could use the Spotify API to get the metadata of my favourite songs and use those information to download the same songs from Youtube using the Youtube API!

This is a personal program.
